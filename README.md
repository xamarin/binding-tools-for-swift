# Xamarin Binding Tools For Swift

## Welcome!

This module is the main repository for Binding Tools for Swift.

This is a set of tools that can consume a compiled Apple Swift library and generates wrappers that allow it to be surfaced as a .NET library.

## Quickstart

Check out our [quickstart guide](QUICKSTART.md) to build and run the tool locally.

The packaging of BTFS is still evolving, and we expect to provide a binding project style interface to make this process easier in the future.

## Current Status

### What Binds?
- Classes
- Structs
- Enums
- Protocols *without* associated types
- Top-level functions and variables
- Generic classes, structs, and enums
- Escaping closures
- Support of `@ObjC` types
- Protocol composition types in non-virtual methods
- Exceptions
- Extensions

### What Doesn’t Bind Yet?
- Protocols with associated types
- Bound generic types with closures
- Non-escaping closures

### What Else Can I Expect?
- An `open` class in Swift can be subclassed in C# and the subclass can be passed in to Swift. Overridden virtual methods in C# will be called when invoked from Swift.
- A C# type implementing an interface bound to a Swift protocol can be passed in to Swift. Methods and properties in the C# interface implementation will be called when invoked from Swift.
- At runtime, the generated code honors the Swift Automatic Reference Counting as well as .NET garbage collection.
- When writing bindings, the code generator tries hard to generate something. If an API uses a type that’s not supported yet, that API will be flagged and skipped.

## Technical Documentation

The [docs](https://github.com/xamarin/binding-tools-for-swift/tree/master/docs) directory contains a detailed walkthrough of how things work under the hood.

In particular the [functional outline](https://github.com/xamarin/binding-tools-for-swift/blob/master/docs/FunctionalOutline.md) is a great place to start exploring.
